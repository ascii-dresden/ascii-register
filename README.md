# ascii-register
Little python3 script that counts the register money and creates a proposed staggering for the envelope.

## Usage

Just call the script with ``python count_reg.py`` and insert the amount of coins and bills when prompted.

__!It's gonna crash with python 2. Make sure you use python 3!__

The values for the table in the _Kassenbuch_ will be displayed (recheck against typos or miscounts).

The proposed staggering displays, how many bills and coins of which kind should be put into the envelope. It should work but is stupid, for more information read the __disclaimer__.

## Disclaimer

The script is stupid and won't calculate the staggering that intelligent. Don't trust it, recheck it and adjust the staggering.

Leave some 5 and 10 euro bills in the register, just replace them with some 2 or 1 euro coins.

Also this is probably pretty bad python. Haven't written that much python code yet. But it should work (\*smile*).
